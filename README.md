Architecture
-Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, 
and the single-page application (SPA).
We used express for the customer facing side so that the pages would load quicker for the customer, but for the admin side we used 
angular since it is okay if the admin side goes a bit slower to load everything we need to see. 

-Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The mongoDB database made it easier for the information to get stored. The more trips that get added, the more difficult it would 
be to handle that load of information. We also didn't have to load and reload the database each time.

Functionality
-How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? 
JSON is a bit easier for users to read and it still makes sense to the computer as well. In an array format in javascript, 
it would be a lot more confusing. It ties together the front end and back end because it works with javascript in order to 
load the web data.

-Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the 
benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
We added a taskbar to make the page a little bit more user friendly, as well as added the functionality where the user can click 
on the photo of the trip they want to go to and it will lead them to the page describing the trip in full. We also added an 
authentication service tot he admin side to make sure that the person using it would actually have the permissions needed to 
access and add/delete data.

Reflection
-How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this 
course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course was the first time that I worked with anything related to http, so I feel like I've learned a lot of the basics that 
come with creating a website, as well as a lot of skills to adding different types of functionality to said website. I was 
surprised to see just how much goes into making one simple page, and how many different areas there were for error in the code 
as well as places that could be considered vulnerabilities. I really enjoyed the course though and hope to continue learning more 
about how the front end plays a part
